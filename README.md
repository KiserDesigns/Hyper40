# Hyper40

Hyper40 is 40%+ keyboard based on the Hyper7.

The PCB is powered by an RP2040, and is pre-flashed with Vial firmware, based on QMK.

Firmware source is found in the `Firmware` directory. A precompiled .uf2 file is in this root directory.

Use this version of Vial to compile the firmware: https://github.com/NCKiser/vial-nckiser/commit/2a0371c2ef1b1343f7dda704ad11ff06da6e896c
